# employee-tracker
A basic app for tracking employee information such as ID, name and department.

## Summary
- using mysql we can add data into a database using the command line and even edit and remove data entered.
- I attempted to make a database with a series of tables to keep track of some employee information for an office inclusing their roles and ids.

## Features
- a server.js file that contains a majority of the code to provide the prompts to the user and to pass the data through.
- two sql files for creating and managing the database

## Challenges
- I was able to get the user prompts functioning but ran into some snags with getting the db to communicate with the server.js properly.
